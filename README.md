# Company XYZ Financial Performance Analysis (Power BI)
## Exploring Profitability, Sales Trends, and Market Insights

## Overview
This project is my first attempt at creating a Power BI dashboard, following a tutorial from **[this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmhQCQr_DCA)**. The analysis is based on Company XYZ, a fictional company, and explores its financial performance using Power BI.

The report examines:
- Profit trends over time
- Top-selling cookie products
- Regional sales distribution
- Impact of country population on sales performance

By integrating external population data with financial records, this project provides data-driven insights for better decision-making and business strategy.
